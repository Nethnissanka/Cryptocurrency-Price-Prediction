# Project Title: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Description:
This project focuses on predicting cryptocurrency prices (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin) using machine learning techniques. We applied data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using the Random Forest Regressor to analyze market trends and forecast future prices.

## Key Features:
- Data collection and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature extraction).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (box plots, scatter plots, etc.).
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training and evaluating machine learning models (Random Forest Regressor).
- Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) scores.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
